- # 8-bit ALU Design using VHDL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL.  
The ALU performs multiple arithmetic and logical operations based on control signals.

The design was simulated using ModelSim and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado.

---

## ⚙️ Features
The ALU supports the following operations:

- Addition (A + B)
- Subtraction (A - B)
- Bitwise AND
- Bitwise OR
- Bitwise XOR
- NOT operation
- Increment
- Decrement
- Left Shift
- Right Shift

Operation selection is controlled using a 4-bit select line.

---

## 🏗 Block Diagram
The ALU consists of:
- Two 8-bit input operands (A and B)
- 4-bit select line
- Arithmetic unit
- Logic unit
- Output multiplexer
- 8-bit result output
- Carry / Zero flags (if implemented)

---
---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- VHDL
- ModelSim (Simulation)
- Xilinx Vivado (Synthesis & Implementation)
- FPGA Board (if used)

---

## ▶️ Simulation Procedure
1. Compile alu.vhd
2. Compile alu_tb.vhd
3. Run simulation
4. Verify waveform outputs for different select inputs

---

## 📊 Output
The ALU generates:
- 8-bit Result
- Carry flag
- Zero flag (if implemented)

Waveforms verify correct operation for all select conditions.

---

## 🎯 Applications
- Microprocessors
- Digital Signal Processing
- Embedded Systems
- FPGA-based system design

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add overflow flag
- Add multiplication/division
- Design pipelined ALU
- Integrate with CPU architecture
